# Pesto Todo Zeta

A fullstack todo app built with Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, and many more.

## Setup

- Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/qurashi-akeel/pesto-todo-zeta.git
```

> I would appriciate if you fork it instead of cloning directly. And also give it a star.

- Install pnpm:

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

- Install dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

- Copy the .env.example file and create your own .env.local file:

```
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Accordingly change the contents of .env.local as per your environment.

- Run dev server:

```
pnpm dev
```
